The RNS Registry is the contract that stores the ownership of the nodes.

When an address is registered, the [Registrar contract](/Architecture/Registrar) stores the name in the Registry contract:  when an auction is finalized, Registrar calls the `setSubnodeOwner` method using the root node as parent node.

## Abstract

**Node**

The node is the main structure of the RIF Name Service Registry. A node has an owner, a Resolver and a time to live (TTL). A node owner can:
- Register sub nodes derived from it, with their owners
- Set the node's Resolver: Resolvers are responsible for performing resource lookups for a name - for instance, returning a contract address, a content hash, or IP address(es) as appropriate.
- Set the node's TTL: the caching time-to-live.
- Transfer node's ownership

**The root node**

The root node is the parent of top-level domains. This node is located in the `0x00` position of the Register, and its owner is the Registry deployer.

**Top level domains**

Top level domains are nodes derived from the root node. These domains are set in the [Registrar contract](/Architecture/Registrar) deployment. RNS top level domain is `rsk`. The `rsk` top level domain name-hash is stored in the Registry contract.

**Domains**

Domains are acquired by winning an auction in the Registrar contract. When the auction is finalized, a new record is stored in the Registry contract, derived from the `rsk` top level domain. This registered domain has the Deed owner as default owner, and its parent Resolver as the default Resolver.

**Subdomain**

Once a domain is registered in the Registry, the owner can create subdomains derived from it. This will register new nodes in the Registry. Each of this sub nodes have the same characteristics of the parent node: it's owners may create sub nodes derived from it, or transfer the sub node's ownership.

## Acquire a domain

There are 3 ways to acquire a domain:
- Win an auction for an open domain (view [Registrar contract](/Architecture/Registrar))
- Be delegated a subdomain
- Be transferred a domain

### Set a subdomain

Subdomain creation is made through the `setSubnodeOwner` method of the Registry. Let's see an example:

```js
const node = namehash('nakamoto.rsk');
const label = web3.sha3('satoshi');

const owner = '0xc5032...';
const newOwner = '0x23fb8...';

rns.setSubnodeOwner(node, label, newOwner)
```

In this example we are adding the entry 'satoshi.nakamoto.rsk' to the Registry and assigning ownership of it to '0x23fb8...'. The subdomain is created using its parent Resolver.

Then, we can query:

```js
var owner = rns.owner('satoshi.nakamoto.rsk')
// 0x23fb8...
```

The new subdomain behaves as any node, so its new owner can repeat the process and create new subdomains under that node, for example 'wallet.satoshi.nakamoto.rsk' or 'donations.satoshi.nakamoto.rsk'. Also the new owner is the one who can change the Resolver.

The owner of the original domain can call `setSubnodeOwner` at any time and override ownership of their subdomain, removing '0x23fb8...' as the owner of 'satoshi.nakamoto.rsk'. However, the sub-subdomains previously created will still exist, so unless the domain owner overrides ownership of them, they will keep resolving to their configured address.

## Change the Resolver

Once you gain ownership over a domain you must configure the name resolution for said domain. For more information about resolutions have a look at [Resolver contract](/Architecture/Resolver) and '[Resolving a name](/Operation/Resolve-a-name)'.

```js
var node = namehash('adomain.rsk')
var newResolverAddress = '0xe87ba...'

rns.setResolver(node, newResolverAddress)
```

Now that the resolver is configured, you have to configure which is the desired domain it has to resolve to. This is done using the `setAddr` method:

```js
var node = namehash('adomain.rsk')

var resolverAddress = rns.resolver(node)
var resolverInstance = web3.contract(resolverAddress)
var resolver = resolverInstance.at(resolverAddress)

var resolveTo = '0x9eb63...'
resolver.setAddr(node, resolveTo)
```

## Transfer ownership

Any entry from the Registry, domain or subdomain, can be delegated through the `setOwner` method. However, in the case of domains gained through auctions, this won't update the information at Registrar or Deed level, so the owner won't be allowed to perform auctions such as releasing the domain.

A full domain transference should be done through the `transfer` method of the Registrar, which handles not only the Registry update but changes the owner of the Deed as well. Note that when transferring the Deed you are also transferring the tokens locked within it.

## Release a domain ownership

A domain can be released at any point through the `releaseDeed` method of the Registrar. This closes the Deed, returning part of the funds to the owner, clears auction related values and deletes the entry from the Registry, returning the name to the Open state.

## Structure

**Types**
```js
struct Record {
    address owner;
    address resolver;
    uint64 ttl;
}
```

**Storage**
```js
mapping(bytes32=>Record) records;
```

For each `namehash`:
- `owner`: the one who can perfom `setOwner`, `setTTL`, `setSubnodeOwner` or `setResolver` methods fo the namehash
- `ttl`: the caching time-to-live
- `resolver`: the address of the Resolver contract that resolves a specific domain

## Methods

#### owner

```js
function owner(bytes32 node) public view returns (address)

```js
function setOwner(bytes32 node, address ownerAddress) public only_owner(node)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the node to transfer ownership of.

#### setSubnodeOwner

Transfers ownership of a sub node `keccak256(node, label)` to a new address. May only be called by the owner of the parent node.

**Signature**
```js
function setSubnodeOwner(bytes32 node, bytes32 label, address ownerAddress) public only_owner(node)
